# Soft-Rigid Hybrid Trimmed Helicoid Robots

This repository contains code, data, and design files for the paper TITLE.

## Robot Code
We provide a software library to control a 10 DOF robot with a rigid vertical axis rotation at the base and three 3-DOF soft segments (currently modeled with the piecewise constant curvature model). 
The library is implemented in Python.
### 1. Dependencies

Dynamixel SDK

```bash
pip install blah blah blah
```

### 2. 


## Design File
The design is open source and CAD is implemented in Onshape.
